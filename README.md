# Tumor-Microenvironment-Risk

The statistical analyses and visualization were performed by R software (version 4.0.5, except for oncoPredict package requesting R 4.2.0) and GraphPad Prism (version 8.0.1). All code is Storaged in [code](/example/profile.md)

The TMErisk model in our research represents the first attempt to anticipate tumor tolerance in immune microenvironment via degree of immune infiltration in HCCs. We sincerely hope ICI treatment would be more precise and well-targeted for suitable populations in the near future. In addition, you can visual our reserach at [briefings in bioinformatics](https://academic.oup.com/bib?login=false "悬停显示")
